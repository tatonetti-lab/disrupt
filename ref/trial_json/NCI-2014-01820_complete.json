To compare the invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with residual basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who are randomized to post-preoperative platinum based chemotherapy with those who are randomized to capecitabine.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and response-free survival (RFS) in the two arms in patients with TNBC with residual basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nII. To characterize the side effects and tolerability of each platinum agent (cisplatin and carboplatin) as well as capecitabine in patients with TNBC with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nIII. To identify the rate of basal-like gene expression using prediction analysis of microarray 50 (PAM50) analysis by digital messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) quantitation amongst drug-resistant residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nIV. To compare the IDFS in TNBC patients with residual non-basal-like disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy who are randomized to post-preoperative platinum based chemotherapy with those who are randomized to capecitabine (exploratory analysis).\r\nV. To assess the difference in health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the platinum based and capecitabine chemotherapy arms.\r\nVI.

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. At present, upon completion of chemotherapy and surgery, the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer is observation. However, recent studies have shown that giving capecitabine after completion of chemotherapy and surgery is a better treatment than receiving no treatment and also that platinum-based chemotherapy after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery may prevent residual triple-negative breast cancer from returning. This trial compares the benefit of adding a platinum agent vs. capecitabine to the treatment regimen, following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery in patients with residual triple-negative breast cancer.",
