To determine the rates of local recurrence as defined by ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence at 5 years in patients with low-intermediate and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) following treatment with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine relapse-free survival in women with DCIS following breast conserving surgery (BCS) and IORT at 5 years.\r\nII. To determine overall survival in women with DCIS following BCS and IORT at 5 years.\r\nIII. To identify and quantify the frequency of any grade >= 2 acute (=< 6 month) and long-term radiation toxicity following IORT.\r\nIV. To evaluate acute (=< 6 month) and long-term cosmetic outcomes following IORT.\r\nV. To determine acute and long-term physician-reported toxicity burden.\r\nVI. To determine acute and long-term patient-reported outcomes of cosmesis, quality of life, breast symptoms, and toxicity burden following IORT.\r\nVII. To identify and quantify the rates of mammographic changes following IORT.\r\nVIII. To determine the rates of additional follow-up imaging and biopsies performed for mammographic changes.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate predictors (patient, treatment, and tumor-related) of short-term and long-term outcomes.\r\nII. To determine the level of agreement between provider and patient-reported assessments of toxicity, cosmesis, quality of life, and toxicity burden following IORT.\r\nIII. To explore the correlation of blood-based, breast tumor microenvironment, and other potential predictive biomarkers with response to IORT.\r\nIV. To investigate the use of Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Technology (RABiT) to evaluate predictors of radiosensitivity.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients undergo breast conserving surgery and immediately undergo intraoperative radiation therapy over 15-40 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 6 weeks, at 6 months, then yearly for 5 years.",

Intraoperative radiation therapy is given one time in the operating room, directly to the site from where the tumor was removed. It may prevent the ductal carcinoma in situ from returning and may cause minimal or no damage to normal tissue and organs.",
