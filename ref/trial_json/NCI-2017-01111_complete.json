Recall rates are defined as the number of screening examinations that are interpreted as BIRADS 0, 3, 4a, b, c, and 5 divided by the total number of screening examinations. Recall rates for each screening occasion and over the full set of screens will be estimated using Wilson intervals and compared across arms using two-sided tests for binomial proportions. Logistic regression will be used to analyze potential differences across patient subsets.",

Mean values and preliminary tolerance limits of all image quality-related variables have been established during the lead-in study. Systematic differences in these variables between TM and DM, and among machine types will be quantified and tested for consistency between the multiple units from each vendor using standard t-tests. Temporal fluctuations in these variables will be assessed in terms of variance about mean values.",
