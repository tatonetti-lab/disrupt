Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Part 2 will\r\n      further evaluate the safety and efficacy at the pediatric RP2D.\r\n\r\n      The primary hypothesis of this study is that intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab\r\n      to children with either advanced melanoma; a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory\r\n      solid tumor or other lymphoma; advanced, relapsed or refractory MSI-H solid tumor; or rrcHL,\r\n      will result in an Objective Response Rate (ORR) greater than 10% for at least one of these\r\n      types of cancer. The 10% assessment does not apply to the MSI-H and TMB-H cohorts.\r\n\r\n      With Amendment 8, enrollment of participants with solid tumors and of participants aged 6\r\n      months to <12 years with melanoma were closed. Enrollment of participants aged \u226512 years to\r\n      \u226418 years with melanoma continues. Enrollment of participants with MSI-H and TMB-H solid\r\n      tumors also continues.",
