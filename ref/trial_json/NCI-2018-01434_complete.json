Determine if systematic light exposure (sLE) prevents cancer-related fatigue (CRF) from worsening in breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing anthracycline-containing (AC) adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nII. Determine whether sLE improves sleep, depression and circadian activity rhythms.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Investigate whether sLE normalizes circadian cortisol rhythms.\r\nII. Examine whether the effects of sLE on fatigue are mediated by sleep, depressive symptoms, and/or circadian activity rhythms.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. \r\n\r\nGROUP I: Patients undergo the sLE experimental condition using a Litebook or light glasses once daily (QD) in the morning for 30 minutes. Treatment continues for the entire duration of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nGROUP II: Patients undergo the sLE comparison condition as in Group I.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study intervention patients are followed up at 1 week, and then at 1, 3, and 6 months.",

        "brief_summary": "Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is a stressful and constant tiredness related to cancer and/or its treatment. CRF is the most intense during treatment and can severely interfere with activities of daily living, such as tasks that require physical strength or thinking clearly. Prevalence of CRF has been reported to be as high as 94% during chemotherapy and as high as 34% five years after completion of treatment. There is currently no generally-accepted treatment for CRF. However, there is evidence to suggest that light therapy can help with CRF. Non-pharmacological interventions for CRF have also been studied but are costly to implement and involve significant patient burden, particularly among those in active treatment. Given the clinical impact of CRF, the goal of this project is to investigate a novel, low-cost and low-burden intervention for Breast Cancer patients using a particular kind of light treatment called systematic light exposure to treat CRF. Two hundred forty-eight breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be recruited from Mount Sinai Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The light will be administered by a small, personal Litebox daily throughout entire duration of chemotherapy. Outcomes will be assessed at eight time points during chemo, and a series of follow up assessments at 1 week, 1-month, 3-months and 6-months post-chemotherapy.",
