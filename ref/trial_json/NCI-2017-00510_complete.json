Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

Upon administration, TrkA/B/C/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor RXDX-101 binds to and inhibits TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK. Inhibition of these kinases may result in a disruption of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1-, and ALK-mediated signaling. This leads to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in tumor cells that express these kinases. TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
