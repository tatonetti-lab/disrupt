To quantify changes in humoral immune responses by antibody profiling at baseline and following treatment.\r\nX.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The primary causes of death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is primarily a process mediated by molecules promoting inflammation that in turn leads to profound lung injury. BMS-986253 is a human monoclonal antibody against the inflammation promoting mediator called interleukin-8 (IL-8), with potential antineoplastic activities. BMS-986253 may help to improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.",
