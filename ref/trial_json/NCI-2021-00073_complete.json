To assess the correlation between TMEM-MRI permeability(qTPERM) and TMEM density.\r\nII. To assess the correlation between TMEM-MRI permeability(qTPERM) and Mena^Calc.\r\nIII. To assess the correlation between TMEM-MRI permeability(qTPERM) and Mena^INV.\r\nIV. To assess the correlation between TMEM-MRI permeability(qTPERM) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).\r\nV. To explore combining standard clinical MRI with TMEM-MRI imaging.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive a gadolinium contrast agent intravenously (IV), and then undergo TMEM-MRI over 1 hour. Patients who have not had a breast biopsy also undergo fine needle aspiration of the breast.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 12 months after TMEM-MRI.",

Tumor microenvironment of metastasis - magnetic resonance imaging (TMEM-MRI) has the ability to detect tumor areas with more leakiness (perfusion), where tumor cells may enter blood vessels to travel to other areas in the body. TMEM-MRI is a test that uses magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body. TMEM-MRI may be able to identify tumors with high leakiness that may have a higher chance of coming back after breast cancer treatment, and may also be able help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment.",
