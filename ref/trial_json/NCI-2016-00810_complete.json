(Part 1: Safety Run-in)\r\nII. To assess the objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with MK-3475 in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, compared to carboplatin and gemcitabine alone. (Part 2)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To establish the fixed dose of 200 mg of MK-3475 as tolerated dose (TD) in combination with the proposed dose of carboplatin and gemcitabine by measuring the number of evaluable patients with dose limiting toxicities (DLT's) - DLT's assessed during the first cycle of dosing. (Part 1: Safety Run-in)\r\nII. To assess the safety profile combination MK-3475 plus carboplatin and gemcitabine. (Part 1: Safety Run-in)\r\nIII. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks according to RECIST v1.1. (Part 2)\r\nIV. To assess progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and the overall survival (OS) according to RECIST v1.1. (Part 2)\r\nV. To assess duration of response (DOR) as per RECIST v1.1 and assessed by three parameters: duration of overall response, duration of CR/PR, and duration of SD. (Part 2)\r\nVI. To assess the safety profile of the combination MK-3475 plus carboplatin and gemcitabine. (Part 2)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To correlate biomarkers related to PD-1 blockade (such as stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes [sTILs], PD-1, PD-L1, programmed PD-L2, and CTLA-4) with clinical benefit rate, progression free survival, overall survival, and duration of response (DOR).\r\nII. To characterize molecular and biological profile of tumors responding to MK-3475 in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine based on the expression level of sTILs, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and T-regulatory cells (T-regs) in tumor samples.\r\nIII. To assess the effect of MK-3475 on inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood such as T-cell related systemic immune changes; in particular, T cell subsets, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytolytic granules/regulatory T (Treg) cells in relation to the proposed treatment.\r\nIV. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks, the progression-free survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) according to immune response (ir)RECIST.\r\nV. To assess the duration of response (DOR) as per irRECIST using three parameters: duration of overall response, duration of overall CR and duration of stable disease.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 cohorts.\r\n\r\nCOHORT A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8, and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nCOHORT B: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve progressive disease may crossover to cohort A.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 and 12 weeks for up to 2 years.",

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to the other places in the body.",
