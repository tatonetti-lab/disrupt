Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
