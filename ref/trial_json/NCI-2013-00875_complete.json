To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes but not to the dissected axilla in terms of the incidence of invasive loco-regional recurrences in patients with a positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r\nII.

To estimate the incidence of arm lymphedema.\r\nII. To estimate the incidence of breast lymphedema for patients who underwent breast conserving surgery based on the specific treatment rendered to the axilla.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo axillary lymph node dissection. Beginning 3-12 weeks following surgery, patients undergo nodal radiation therapy comprising 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or proton radiation therapy (PRT) 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo axillary and nodal radiation therapy comprising 3D-CRT, IMRT, or PRT 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 6 months for years 1-2 and then annually for years 3-8.",
