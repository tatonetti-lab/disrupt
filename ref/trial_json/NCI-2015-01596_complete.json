To study whether the frequency of upgrade (in an excisional biopsy) to invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS in patients with a core biopsy diagnosis (from the local pathologist) of intraductal papilloma without atypia (IPWA) or flat epithelial atypia (FEA) may differ from what has been reported in the literature.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To estimate the frequency of upgrade (in an excisional biopsy) to invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS in patients with a core biopsy diagnosis (from central pathology review) of IPWA or FEA.\r\nII. To describe the characteristics of lesions that are upgraded and of lesions that are not upgraded to carcinoma.\r\nIII. To create a registry of tissue (paraffin blocks from core and excisional biopsies) for correlative studies.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To perform deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutational analysis in columnar cell lesions (CCL).\r\nII. To correlate upstaging to DCIS or invasive breast cancer with gene signatures characterizing FEA or IPWA.\r\nIII. To explore stromal homeobox (HOX) gene expression in FEA and IPWA.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients undergo an image-guided excisional biopsy within 6 months of protocol registration.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up within 30 days.",

Studying tissue samples from patients with FEA or IPWA may help doctors determine how often cancer is identified by excisional biopsy near an initial core biopsy where FEA or IPWA has previously been seen. It may also help doctors advise their patients as to whether they need to have a surgical biopsy, when FEA or IPWA are seen on needle biopsy, to rule out the presence of breast cancer.",
