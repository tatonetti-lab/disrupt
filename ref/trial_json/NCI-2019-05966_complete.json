To determine the time to development of castrate resistance after treatment with REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody), ADT, and docetaxel in newly mHSPC patients.\r\nII. To evaluate radiographic response after treatment with REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody), ADT, and docetaxel in newly mHSPC patients.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To test whether immunotherapy changes the tumor microenvironment (TME) by coupling gene expression data with matched, full-length, paired clonotype sequence information pre- and post-treatment with REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody) and/or ADT using single cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence (seq) analysis.\r\nII. To understand if a treatment-driven immune signature exists with treatment of REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody) and/or ADT by evaluating pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples using single cell analysis.\r\nIII. To correlate gene expression data from metastases with circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during treatment course with REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody), ADT, and docetaxel.\r\nIV. To determine the effects of combination REGN2810 (anti-PD1 antibody), ADT and docetaxel on cytokine levels including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta.\r\nV. To determine if clinically meaningful increase in disease control is associated with an alteration in overall quality of life (QOL).\r\nVI. Additional studies may be performed at later date.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients undergo biopsy at baseline and between weeks 3-4 or weeks 8-10. Patients also receive degarelix subcutaneously (SC) at week 1, leuprolide acetate SC every 3 months beginning weeks 4, cemiplimab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks during weeks 4-55, and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on every 3 weeks during weeks 10-25. Treatment continues for up to 55 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months up to 1 year, every 6 months up to 2 years and then annually up to 5 years.",

Leuprolide binds to and activates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Continuous, prolonged administration of leuprolide in males results in pituitary GnRH receptor desensitization and inhibition of pituitary secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to a significant decline in testosterone production; in females, prolonged administration results in a decrease in estradiol production. This agent reduces testosterone production to castration levels and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression.

Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.  This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.  Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Leuprolide and degarelix lowers the amount of testosterone made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body\u2019s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, is safe and improves response to therapy.",
