True abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient, is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug (ie, 60 days after discontinuing study drug or 5 times the terminal elimination half-life, whichever is longer). Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)"

Cohorts will enroll at least\r\n      3 patients in accordance with a traditional dose escalation 3+3 design, and the study will\r\n      determine the MTD/RP2D of LNS8801. With permission from the Safety Review Committee (SRC), 2\r\n      cohorts may be expanded to include 8 to 10 patients to further explore PK and\r\n      pharmacodynamics. LNS8801 will be administered 3 days/week or once or twice a day during 21\r\n      day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.\r\n\r\n      Safety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their\r\n      participation in the study, and for 30 days (90 days in combination cohorts) following the\r\n      last dose of study drug. Throughout the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor\r\n      response and/or progression will be performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible\r\n      lesions.\r\n\r\n      After the RP2D of LNS8801 is identified and the safety of dosing LNS8801 with pembrolizumab\r\n      has been established, expansion cohorts and Phase 2A cohorts will open. Any 2 dose escalation\r\n      cohorts may be expanded to 8 to 10 patients to include additional patients to further explore\r\n      PK and PD.\r\n\r\n      This protocol also includes RP2D PD-1/L1 refractory expansion cohorts of advanced cancer\r\n      patients who have previously had a clinical benefit on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy alone or in\r\n      combination (complete response or partial response of any duration, or confirmed stable\r\n      disease for at least 16 weeks) but have since relapsed and not had an intervening cytotoxic\r\n      chemotherapy. Up to 28 patients may be studied in each cohort with LNS8801 therapy alone or\r\n      with a combination of LNS8801 and pembrolizumab. The monotherapy cohort will also study\r\n      patients that are no longer eligible for PD-1/L1 therapy due to serious immune related side\r\n      effects to prior therapy regardless of response to the prior therapy.\r\n\r\n      The study will also include the following 12 cohorts.\r\n\r\n      Monotherapy:\r\n\r\n      COHORT M1: 10 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies having received \u22644 prior lines\r\n      of prior systemic therapy will be treated with the monotherapy RP2D of LNS8801. Immediate\r\n      prior line of therapy must have been anti-PD-1/L1 (mono or combination) therapy with\r\n      demonstrated clinical benefit (complete response or partial response of any duration, or\r\n      stable disease for \u226516 weeks) and subsequent progression of disease with no intervening\r\n      cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Eligible patients must either\r\n      have no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations or have not demonstrated disease response on or\r\n      following FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will\r\n      otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.\r\n\r\n      COHORT C4: 10 patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell\r\n      Cancer (HNSCC) expressing PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] \u22651 and \u226419) as determined by\r\n      an FDA-approved test will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab.\r\n      Disease can either be treatment-naive or with disease progression on or following\r\n      platinum-containing chemotherapy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be\r\n      consistent with those criteria specified above.\r\n\r\n      COHORT C5: 10 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma that is refractory to or ineligible for\r\n      an approved standard-of-care therapy and have not been previously treated with a PD-1/L1\r\n      therapy will be treated with the combination of LNS8801 plus pembrolizumab. Inclusion and\r\n      exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with those criteria specified above.\r\n\r\n      COHORT C6: 10 patients with advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma that is refractory to or\r\n      ineligible for an approved standard-of-care therapy will be treated with the combination of\r\n      LNS8801 + pembrolizumab. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will otherwise be consistent with\r\n      those criteria specified above.\r\n\r\n      Assuming pembrolizumab is not contraindicated, enrollment to cohorts M1 and C1, cohorts M2\r\n      and C2, and cohorts M5 and C5 will occur in parallel with assignment of patients based on a\r\n      simple central randomization conducted by the study CRO. If pembrolizumab is contraindicated,\r\n      the patient will be assigned to the next appropriate monotherapy cohort, if possible.\r\n\r\n      To further evaluate the correlation of prolactin response and antitumor activity, in all\r\n      study cohorts, \u22655/10 patients with prolactin response (a 25% or greater increase in\r\n      circulating prolactin on Cycle 1, Day 1) must be evaluated. If \u02c25/10 patients are available\r\n      for evaluation in any cohort, up to 5 additional patients will be enrolled to ensure\r\n      evaluation of at least 5 prolactin responders.\r\n\r\n      Up to 200 patients will be accrued for this study at up to ten study sites in the United\r\n      States.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
