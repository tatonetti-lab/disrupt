Dose escalation cohorts\r\n      enrolled at least 3 patients in accordance with a traditional dose escalation 3+3 design, and\r\n      the study will determine the MTD/RP2D of LNS8801. LNS8801 will be administered orally 3\r\n      days/week or once or twice a day during 21 day cycles until disease progression or\r\n      unacceptable toxicity occurs.\r\n\r\n      Safety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their\r\n      participation in the study, and for 30 days (90 days in combination cohorts) following the\r\n      last dose of study drug. Throughout the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor\r\n      response and/or progression will be performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible\r\n      lesions.\r\n\r\n      After the RP2D of LNS8801 is identified and the safety of dosing LNS8801 with pembrolizumab\r\n      has been established, expansion cohorts and Phase 2A cohorts will open. Any 2 dose escalation\r\n      cohorts may be expanded to 8 to 10 patients to include additional patients to further explore\r\n      PK and PD.\r\n\r\n      Phase 1B expansion cohorts include a monotherapy cohort (LNS8801 alone) of melanoma patients\r\n      (not uveal) who are now not eligible for additional anti-PD-1 therapy in the judgement of the\r\n      investigator because of prior severe immune related adverse events and a combination therapy\r\n      (LNS8801 + pembrolizumab) cohort in anti-PD-1/L1 refractory advanced cancer patients who have\r\n      previously had clinical benefit on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy alone or in combination (complete\r\n      response or partial response of any duration, or confirmed stable disease for at least 16\r\n      weeks) but have since relapsed and not had an intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
