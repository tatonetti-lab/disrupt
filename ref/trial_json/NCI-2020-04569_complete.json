Tocilizumab targets and binds to both the soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) and the membrane-bound form (mIL-6R), thereby blocking the binding of IL-6 to its receptor. This prevents IL-6-mediated signaling. Il-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response, is overproduced in autoimmune disorders and certain types of cancers.

Immune-related side effects are caused by activation of the immune system from treatment with immunotherapy. Steroids can cause many side effects with prolonged use including problems with sleep, weight gain, diabetes, muscle loss, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bone loss, and mood disturbances. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving rituximab or tocilizumab may manage immune-related side effects and ultimately help cancer patients get off steroids.",
