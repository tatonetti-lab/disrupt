Initial diagnosis of HCC may be made using standard-of-care radiographic parameters, however, pre-treatment core needle biopsies are mandatory for all cohorts. Patients can be consented, and pre-treatment and diagnostic biopsies can be done simultaneously if the imaging leaves little doubt in the investigator\u2019s mind that the patient carries the required diagnosis (e.g. HCC); patients where the diagnosis is not appropriately confirmed will be considered screen-failures. HCC lesions must be T1b or larger, meaning 2 cm or larger, in order to be enrolled in this trial. The NSCLC cohort will enroll any patient with T1b or more advanced (> 1cm primary tumor). Both cohorts will enroll only patients whose tumor is deemed amenable to surgical or core needle biopsy by a multidisciplinary team including a medical oncologist and an interventionalist (radiologist, surgeon, pulmonologist or hepatologist)"

To ascertain the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy on patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, as is measured on pathological evaluation of resected tumors, which serve as surrogates of clinical efficacy.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Time from first dose of therapy to surgery, measured as the time in days that elapses between the first dose of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection.\r\nII. Safety and tolerability.\r\nIII. Radiographic response to therapy.\r\nIV. Progression-free survival (PFS).\r\nV. Overall survival (OS).\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Correlation of radiomics parameters and histologic response to therapy.\r\nII. Creation of dynamic atlases documenting the evolution of a patient\u2019s tumor microenvironment (TME), comparing pre-treatment biopsy and blood with tumor and blood taken from the patient prior to surgical resection. (Non-clinical objective)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\n\r\nPatients with non-small cell lung cancer are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\r\n\r\nCOHORT A: Patients receive CCR2/CCR5 antagonist BMS-813160 (BMS-813160) orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after the second dose of nivolumab, then after recovery, receive standard of care chemotherapy and 3 additional cycles of nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nCOHORT B: Patients receive anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody HuMax-IL8 (BMS-986253) IV over 120-180 minutes on days 1 and 15 and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after the second dose of nivolumab, then after recovery, receive standard of care chemotherapy and 3 additional cycles of nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nPatients with hepatocellular carcinoma are sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts. \r\n\r\nCOHORT C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after the second dose of nivolumab, then after recovery, receive 3 additional cycles of nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nCOHORT D: Patients receive BMS-813160 PO BID on days 1-28 and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after the second dose of nivolumab, then after recovery, receive 3 additional cycles of nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nCOHORT E: Patients receive BMS-986253 IV over 120-180 minutes on days 1 and 15 and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo surgery after the second dose of nivolumab, then after recovery, receive 3 additional cycles of nivolumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3-4 months for 2 years then every 12 months thereafter.",

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.
