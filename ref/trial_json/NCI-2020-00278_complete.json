Patients may be enrolled into one of 5\r\n      treatment arms:\r\n\r\n      2-Week AGEN2373 monotherapy\r\n\r\n      3-Week AGEN2373 monotherapy\r\n\r\n      4-Week AGEN2373 monotherapy\r\n\r\n      Combination of AGEN2373 and AGEN1181 in patients with programmed cell death protein 1\r\n      (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) relapsed/refractory (R/R) melanoma.\r\n\r\n      Group 1 (Monotherapy Lead-in Combination): Q3W AGEN2373 lead-in followed by Q3W AGEN2373 in\r\n      combination with Q6W AGEN1181. (AGEN2373 will be administered on Day 1 every 3 weeks.\r\n      Starting with Cycle 4 Day 1, AGEN1181 will be added as combination therapy and administered\r\n      every other cycle (Cycles 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.). AGEN1181 is administered every 6 weeks.)\r\n\r\n      Group 2 (Combination): AGEN2373 will be administered Q3W in combination with AGEN1181\r\n      administered every other cycle. (AGEN1181 is administered every 6 weeks.)\r\n\r\n      The trial will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different combination dose\r\n      levels of AGEN2373 monotherapy and in combination with AGEN1181. Each patient will stay on\r\n      the dose level and schedule assigned at trial entry.
