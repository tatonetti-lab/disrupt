Prospectively validate a prior germline predictor of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Specifically, this study will demonstrate that patients with a high-risk TIPN genotype have significantly more grade 2-4 TIPN than patients with a low risk genotype.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Validate a prior germline predictor of TIPN using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (NTX) neurotoxicity subscale in Arm A.\r\nII. Compare grade 2-4 TIPN based on CTCAE between weekly paclitaxel (Arm A) versus (vs.) every three-week docetaxel (Arm B).\r\nIII. Prospectively confirm dose reductions due to TIPN are lower for every three-week docetaxel compared with weekly paclitaxel in a prospective cohort of patients of African ancestry.\r\nIV. Prospectively confirm dose reductions due to any cause are lower for every three-week docetaxel compared with weekly paclitaxel in a prospective cohort of patients of African ancestry.\r\nV. Assess the ability of the high-risk genotype to predict TIPN risk for docetaxel.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Identify novel markers of TIPN and elucidate the mechanism.\r\nII. Whole genome sequencing of germline blood to evaluate for additional predictors of TIPN.\r\nIII. Create induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons from patient samples.\r\nIIIa. Evaluate whether clinical findings can be mimicked in vitro.\r\nIIIb. Evaluate gene expression (ribonucleic acid [RNA] sequencing [seq]) and the epigenome at baseline versus after exposure in those prone to TIPN versus those not.\r\nIV. Create a biorepository of patient derived samples for future translational research.\r\n\r\nPATIENT REPORTED OUTCOME OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Compare grade 2-4 TIPN (moderate to life threatening) based on Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE items between weekly paclitaxel (Arm A) vs. every three-week docetaxel (Arm B).\r\nII. Prospectively compare FACT/GOG-NTX Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) scores (from the FACT-General [G] portion and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Physical Function version [v.]2 Short Form [SF] 10a, scores between every three-week docetaxel and weekly paclitaxel and between high risk and low risk genotypes (Arm A) in a cohort of African ancestry.\r\nIII. Compare Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)-20 sensory neuropathy score between weekly paclitaxel (Arm A) vs. every three-week docetaxel (Arm B).\r\nIV. Compare the impact on financial toxicity (Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity [COST] scores) for every three-week docetaxel compared with weekly paclitaxel.\r\nV. Examine associations between social determinants of health (zip code, marital status, education, income & insurance status) and dose reductions and treatment discontinuation.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours once weekly. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also receive trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab per institution routine care per treating physician\u2019s discretion.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour once every 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, trastuzumab, and/or pertuzumab per institution routine care per treating physician\u2019s discretion.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.",

Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.  This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.  Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving docetaxel or paclitaxel may work better than other methods in reducing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer.",
