(Phase I)\r\nII. Within each disease-specific cohort assess patients for regression of disease in response to in situ vaccine and pembrolizumab in patients with iNHL, MBC and HNSCC. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Overall response rate (ORR) at 12 and 24 months of evaluation from initiation of trial. (Phase II)\r\nII. ORR as per immune-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) criteria. (Phase II)\r\nIII. Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the duration of time from initial recombinant Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) administration to any progression per by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 and iRECIST criteria for MBC (Cohort B) and HNSCC (Cohort C) or as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) criteria for iHNL (Cohort A) patients, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. (Phase II)\r\nIV. Overall Survival (OS) defined as the duration of time from initial Flt3L administration until death from any cause. (Phase II)\r\nV. Adverse events (AEs) measured using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand intratumorally (IT) daily on days 0-4 and 7-10, and undergo radiation therapy (RT) on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive poly-ICLC IT on days 11, 15, 18, 22, 29, 35, 43, and 50, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 22. Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 3 weeks for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 day for 90 days, then every 12 weeks for at least 2 years.",

Flt3 ligand binds to the Flt3 tyrosine kinase receptor and, synergistically with other growth factors, stimulates the proliferation and mobilization of certain bone marrow precursor cells, including CD34+ cells, and dendritic cells. When proteolytically cleaved, the transmembrane isoform of Flt3 ligand generates the  soluble form soluble Flt3 ligand , which is also biologically active.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Flt3L causes the body to make more immune cells, specifically a type of immune cell called \"dendritic cells\". Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Poly-ICLC turns on the immune cells that have been brought to the tumor by Flt3L. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving Flt3L, radiation therapy, poly-ICLC, and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients compared to Flt3L, radiation therapy, and poly-ICLC alone.",
