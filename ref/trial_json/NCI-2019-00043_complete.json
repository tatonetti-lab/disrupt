Isoflurane may inhibit glutamatergic excitatory transmission by increasing glutamate re-uptake and it may potentiate glycine receptor activity, which decreases motor function. In addition, isoflurane may alter certain pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and -10 (IL-6, IL-10), possibly through the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) pathway, which may affect immune responses during surgery.
